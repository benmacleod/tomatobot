    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Tomatobot. I'm a simple Pomodoro timer, and I can join your team in Slack.</p>
    <p>
      Simply add my to your Slack team, then your team can type 
      <code>/startwork</code> and I'll help them stay focused.

<h2>Commands</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h3><code>/startwork</code></h3>
    <p>
      I'll start tracking a new Pomodoro unit. There's no flashy countdown, 
      I'll leave you alone to focus until it's time for a break.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're already working on one Pomodoro and you ask me to 
      <code>/startwork</code>
      I'll let you know how long you have left of the current Pomodoro.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h3><code>/distraction</code></h3>
    <p>
      While you're working, if something distracts you, type this, followed by
      the thing that's distracting you, for example, 
      <code>/distraction reply to Jaakko</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of your current Pomodoro, I'll remind you about the 
      distracitons, so you can forget about them and really focus.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h3><code>/completed</code></h3>
    <p>
      Whether you're currently mid-Pomodoro, or have finished a Pomodoro, this
      lets you record what you acheived. Then, later, we can take a look at
      what you got done together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complete two things? No problem, you can send your acheivements to the 
      <code>/completed</code> command any number of times.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <h3><code>/review</code></h3>
    <p>
      Preparing for a daily standup? Grab a <code>/review</code> and I'll give 
      you a list of your Pomodoros today, and what you got done in each one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typing <code>/review public</code> will make the review visible to 
      the rest of the channel you are currently in. (Adding the word 
      <code>public</code> right after the command works for all of 
      the slash commands, this is just the most useful!).
    </p>
    <p>
      And typing <code>/review 2016-03-12</code>, 
      <code>/review yesterday</code> and <code>/review last Tuesday</code>
      show you what you completed on the respective days;
      <code>/review public yesterday</code> works fine too!
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2 id="help">Help</h2>
    <p>
      From within Slack, you can type any command followed by the word 
      <code>help</code> for some extra information on how to use it. For 
      example <code>/distraction help</code>.

    <p>
      Absolutely minimal information is stored, only IDs made up of letters and 
      numbers, which can't easily be linked with your team, and the details you 
      type for completed and distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database doesn't contain names of teams whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the data will ever be shared, except for maybe some anonymous 
      statistics in the future.
